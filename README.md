# Learning Go

The projects in this directory are myself going through and learning how to use Golang by completing [leetcode](http://www.leetcode.com) problems in Go. This helps me gain familiariy with writing the language, specifics of instatiation (i.e. creating arrays vs pointers to slices), and general comforabtiliy in using go to accomplish things.

This may also double to some readers as a reference on how to solve the problems that these go scripts solve.

## Structure
Each problem is given it's own folder and namespace under `leetcode/PROBLEM_NAME`.

## Running
To run the solution, cd into the folder and run `go run .`.
